# Opus Pro Community health files

> Default community health files are a set of predefined files that provide guidance and templates for maintaining a healthy and collaborative open source project. You can add default community health files to a public repository called `.github`, in the root of the repository or in the `docs` or `.github` folders. These files help you automate and standardize various aspects of your project's development and community interaction. They are essential for promoting transparency, good practices, and collaboration in open source projects.
